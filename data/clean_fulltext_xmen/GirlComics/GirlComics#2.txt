4th story: Elsa Bloodstone lovingly prepares herself a sandwich and plops down on the couch to enjoy it. She drops it the next moment when Tabitha Smith suddenly pops up and shouts she needs to ask her something. Elsa shoots her a death glare and Tabby apologizes. Usually, Elsa’s impossible to sneak up on. What does she want? Elsa asks coolly.  Tabby begins rambling. She went out on a couple of errands today.  Tabby’s story: She spots these kids, maybe twelve, thirteen years old, and they are reading comics and one of them says that, if he had superpowers, like x-ray vision, he’d look into the girl’s locker room at school.  Reality: Charming, Elsa comments. She knows! Tabby agrees. She spent so many years on X-Force, X-Terminators, X-whatever, trying to do some good. Does Elsa ever think about using her superpowers for evil? Elsa can stab to death anything that can be stabbed to death. And Tabby has got mad explosion-making skills… they’d be amazing supervillains. Screw the whole “oh noes, we have to protect the world that hates and fears us” crap! They could use their powers to get what they want all the time! Really getting into it, Tabby muses what her super-villain name would be. Girl Evil or Lady Evil or Eviliciousness or something with evil anyway. She means, that stupid kid she saw today. He doesn’t want superpowers to make the world a better place. He wants them, so he can go see girls in their underwear.  Unfortunately, some people aren’t as noble as others, Elsa remarks. Has she ever thought about it? Tabby asks her. Using her awesome butt-kicking skills to rule the world, rather than save it? Elsa pictures herself on a mountain with an evil laugh, people prostrates at her feet. She’d have a cape made from the Mona Lisa, she admits, and Johnny Depp would be her concubine.  So did Tabby tell off the grotty little brats? Not exactly, Tabby replies. She put little timebombs in their underwear. So much for doing good, huh?
