Mystique, Lady Mastermind and Sabretooth break into the Bank of England. Meanwhile, Wolverine, Kitty Pryde and the past X-Men are confronted by the Uncanny Avengers. Havok and the young Cyclops have a “reunion” of sorts and discuss their current situations. Marvel Girl enters the Scarlet Witch’s mind and learns of the decimation of mutantkind, and starts to get upset and attacks the Scarlet Witch. The Scarlet Witch holds her own against Marvel Girl while Kitty tries to calm her down. The Scarlet Witch tells the past X-Men that this is more complicated than they came imagine, before Captain America reveals the reason his team intercepted the X-Men - because they are wanted felons. Captain America shows them reports of Wolverine and the past X-Men breaking into banks and stealing money, so Wolverine assures Cap that it is Mystique who is doing this. Captain America instructs Wolverine to take the young X-Men back to their school, while the Avengers deal with this. Wolverine, Kitty and the young X-Men don’t return to their school however, while Wolverine informs everyone that they are going to teach Mystique a lesson about stealing.
