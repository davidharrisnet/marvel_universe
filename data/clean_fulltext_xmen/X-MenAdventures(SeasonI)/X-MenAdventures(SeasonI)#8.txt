Gambit's rescuer, Cable, demands to know where the Leader is. Cable shoots at one of the Genoshan soldiers who approaches he and Gambit, before Gambit informs Cable where the Leader is. Cable gives Gambit a key that unlocks his collars, and Gambit asks him if he will help him rescue the mutant prisoners. But Cable is only interested in some payback, and heads off to the factory to find the Leader. There, the Leader is meeting with Trask, Hodge and Gyrich, and he informs them that the mercenary, Cable, was in his army, until he discovered that the Leader was not the champion of democracy that he claimed to be, so he headed for the hills to start a revolution. Gambit arrives at the solitary confinement box where Storm and Jubilee are both being held prisoner. He takes out the guards and rescues his teammates, before heading into the jungle with them. Jubilee is angry at Gambit for betraying her, but Gambit asks for forgiveness, and unlocks their collars with the key he was given by Cable. Storm recovers from her traumatic ordeal inside the small box she was kept in, and vows to wipe the island of its ugliness. At the same time, Cable starts to attack the factory, and while the Leader slips away, Trask, Gyrich and Hodge are left to fend for themselves. The X-Men arrive back at the dam, take out the guards and turn the collars off, enabling the prisoners to use their powers. A Sentinel arrives, and Storm destroys it, before summoning a massive rainstorm which bursts the banks of the dam. Cable finds the Leader, who offers to make a deal, before the water of the lake bursts into the factory and sweeps them both away, while destroying Master Mold. Storm surveys her work, before the other X-Men arrive in the Blackbird. The team is happy to be reunited again, and leave Genosha to return to the X-Mansion â€“ but as they fly towards their home, they are shocked to see that part of it has been demolished!
