The X-Men receive a mental call from Professor Xavier and hurry home. On the way they are delayed by many citizens who celebrate them as heroes. After they finally get back to the mansion, Xavier fills them in on a new villain with mutant powers. He calls himself the Vanisher and has some teleportation ability. This afternoon he robbed the national bank in front of two policemen and simply vanished with the money. To prepare the team for fighting this villain Xavier puts them through some extra training. Meanwhile the Vanisher announces to steal the defense plans from the pentagon and already assembles many crooks into a criminal organisation. Xavier is alerted by agent Fred Duncan, his contact within the FBI, that the Vanisher will make his move soon. The X-Men are asked to help and travel to Washington. As the Vanisher appears he easily steals the plans from the pentagon, but then he has to fight the X-Men. At first they are able to toss the map with the plans around too fast for him, but after using sleeping gas on Jean, the Vanisher gets hold of the plans again and teleports away. The next day the Vanisher demands 10 million dollars for not giving the plans to the countryâ€™s enemies. The following day the Vanisher and his army appear in front of the White House to pick up the money, but the X-Men are waiting for him. Suddenly they step aside and Professor Xavier is seen behind them. He uses his telepathic ability on the villain and blocks his access to his powers and even his memory of who he is. With their leader out of action the crooks are easily defeated by the X-Men.
