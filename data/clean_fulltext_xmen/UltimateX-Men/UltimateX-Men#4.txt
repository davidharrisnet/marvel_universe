Cyclops, startled by the news that Storm told him last issue, asks her for the confirmation. As Storm replies, Cyclops is hit by a shot from a Croatian sniper. Iceman freakes out, but, as Cyclops himself says, "Why do you thing God created Kevlar?", he unleashes one of his optic blasts to destroy the enemy truck. Colossus tries to help Storm and Beast, while Cyke and Iceman try to reach them. unnexpected help arrives in the form of a train that falls above the Croatians as Magneto and his school help secure Beast's body and the rest of the X-Team. Scarlet Witch asks his father why didn't Wolverine use this opportunity to kill the professor. Magneto replies that if Wolverine is "Holding off on a kill just means there's a woman he's trying to get into bed first". At the Institute, Jean Grey and Prof. X are trying to rescue Beast by performing a new type of surgery that's still being tested by a Seattle bio-tech team in animals. Cyclops tells them that he tried to phone Hank's mom to tell her what happened and she didn't even take the call. In the end of the surgery, Wolverine talks with Jean about Hank's condition, Scott's reaction and her feelings for him. Eventually, they kiss as Cyke sees thru the window. He gets his stuff packed and goes to Prof. X to tell him that he decided to leave the school. After some talk, both vocal and telephatically, Scott storms out the mansion and goes to the Savage Land, where he is greeted by Magneto.
