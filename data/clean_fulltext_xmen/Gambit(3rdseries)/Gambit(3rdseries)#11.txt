Daredevil beats on Constrictor; he has bystanders drive off the building as a distraction; DD saves them, then continues the chase. Constrictor has stolen an adamantium stomach, which was supposed to go into Judge Buechler. Remy shows up, fighting both of them. He needs adamantium to save Creed: although his healing factor is restored, he has become dependent on adamantium to survive. They fight on top of a train to Jersey, then all jump off a bridge. Fontanelle investigates Sinister's dreams. A century ago in America, he buys a paper with the headline “Black Womb Killer Acquitted!“ : someone is selling fetuses. Constrictor makes it to Donato's place; as a young man he worked for the mobster and fell in love with his daughter, whom he is now holding hostage for the stomach. His own has been destroyed by ground glass, a slow assassination attempt while he was in prison. Turns out the judge bumped Donato down on the organ donor list; Remy makes a deal: he charges the ground glass, dissipating it, Constrictor donates part of his adamantium coils to Creed, and the jerk Buechler gets the stomach.
