Denti questions the disparity between his roles as FBI agent and as the X-Cutioner. But both halves of him agree to hate Remy. As planned (last iss.), he has Maria Ellenthorpe ambush Rogue with one of his gizmos, to use her as bait. Realizing Rogue is missing, Xavier lectures Remy on total truthfulness within the team, saying he should have informed them about his earlier fight with Denti. (Does anybody remember the Changeling?) The X-Cutioner sends a message, and at his coordinates, the X-Men find a stargate. Apparently a trap, they decide to use it anyway, but it only takes Remy. Fontanelle decides to look at the dreams of the New Son, who hired her to investigate Remy. Strange images: some recognizeable as Rogue and Magneto at the end of the AOA and the Dark Beast. The New Son discovers her presence and kicks her out of his mind. Remy, exhausted, emerges from the stargate. The green energy entity within him breaks loose; they argue briefly, but then she returns to his body. Remy bests the Firing Squad and gets past Denti but is knocked out by his last gizmo. But before Denti can deliver the killing blow, Rogue breaks free, and Remy shoots Denti with his own staff and leaves with Rogue, meeting the X-Men at the other side of the stargate. Denti, his face mask damaged, shoots at the Firing Squad, mistaking them for Rogue and Remy. He realizes his error, too late. Just like his father, an army man who lost control and shot his own men. As X-Cutioner, he should execute himself. Zoe takes her brother Shirow to the New Orleans Thievesâ€™ Guild for sanctuary. The Mengos are right behind her, hunting them down for the Pig.
