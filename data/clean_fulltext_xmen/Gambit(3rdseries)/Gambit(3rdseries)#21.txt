Remy has sent Mercy and Lapin to sneak into the hospital to get his birth records, but there aren't any, like Jean Luc said, and computer records have been erased. The unified Guilds are headquartered at Bella Donna's ancestral mansion. Ministers Tome and Hoard oversee the Unveiling ceremony to open The Casket of All Tomorrows, which turns out to be empty. Courier impersonates Xavier and meets with Denti in the Pentagon to get access to Fred Duncan's files on Black Womb. Turns out Amanda Mueller lived at least until World War II and headed a genetics research program by that name. Mystique, herself impersonating a staffer, realizes Courierâ€™s an imposter, when he, thinking himself unobserved, stands up to get a drink. Bella Donna is mad that the casket was empty, since it was supposed to tell the unified Guilds how to resurrect the Old Kingdom. Tante Mattie says they still have to try, and Remy is the prophesied savior. A fireball explodes in Siberia. Lapin insults Gris Gris, who then starts choking him, so Remy kinetically charges off his dreadlocks. Fontanelle calls Remy, worried because Courier didn't return. Theoren hacks into the Pentagon computers to create a fake meeting, and Remy as Robert Lord walks in, finds Courier, and gets cornered by Mystique. He uses his new power to burn her hand, making her drop her gun, and she realizes she is not up on recent events. He wants to just walk away, but she pulls knives, and he charges her body, forcing her to yield before she dissolves into a blue puddle. Remy summons Theoren and Gris Gris, accusing them of erasing his hospital records and destroying the contents of the casket. They confess, but say Jean Luc LeBeau ordered them.
