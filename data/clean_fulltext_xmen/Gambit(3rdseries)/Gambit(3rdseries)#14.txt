(Year 1891) The Thieves' Guild is trying to steal from Ozymandias for Candra; Jacques (who doesn't know Iehovah from Yahweh) gets them caught, so he asks Ozymandias for information on Apocalypse. He gives them some texts about the Old Kingdom, then Candra shows up. Remy is with Sinister, who released the Guild two weeks ago and offers to restore Courier; now stuck in female form. All this in exchange for a piece of Courier. Remy wants “Jaqueline“ to repeat the trick (iss. #9) of killing the cells he gave to Sinister, but somehow he can’t do it. (present) Fontanelle investigates Rogue's dreams and warns her that Remy needs her help in the past. She needs to go to Jean Luc. Angel, who has decided to be a humanitarian, makes a deal with the New Son and is told he must kill Remy. (Year 1891) Candra traps Ozymandias, and the Guild translates Old Kingdom texts so she can fold space using magic. They are interrupted by Sinister, who uses Apocalypse's transport to do the same, and Remy is with him, cards flying. Sinister has Courier's morphing abilities now and attacks Candra, handing her over to her fellow X-Ternals, who are angry she risked waking Apocalypse. Back in New York, Sinister removes the Guild's memories of the Old Kingdom texts and locks them away in Remy's subconscious. He notices previous work done to the base of his cerebellum, which looks like his own. Remy refuses to explain. Courier summarizes: they have saved the Guild and put the kibosh on Candra, but they gave advanced abilities to Sinister and froze Courier as a woman. Plus, they don't know how to get back to the future.
