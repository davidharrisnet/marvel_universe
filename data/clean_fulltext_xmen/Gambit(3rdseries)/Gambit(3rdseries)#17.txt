Remy has been stabbed by Bullseye and is near death. Three Daredevils appear and chase off Bullseye; they are Fifolet, Gris-Gris, and Questa, who can fiddle with people's minds. Then they track Gambit, their real target, who has meanwhile escaped. Valerie Cooper reports to the Comission on Superhuman Activities that Zaran and Batroc were captured and released, and Denti will track them to Remy. Tante Mattie watches as Remy's enhanced powers heal him; the remnant of the Thieves' Guild plans to find out why there's a contract on him. Fontanelle investigates Courier's dreams; she tells him to choose between Remy and the New Son.Then she goes into Remy's mind and has him replay his fight with Bullseye. He is awakened by Constrictor, who knocked out the Thieves Guild. After a short struggle, Deadpool appears (also as a hit-man), shoots Constrictor, then threatens Remy, who bribes him to let him go (he made some good investments while he was stuck in the past). Farley is now Fireballs, with some of X-Cutioner's toys; Remy quickly dispatches him, then Denti arrives, identifies himself as FBI and Remy goes with him. Suddenly the car is attacked by a new X-Cutioner.
