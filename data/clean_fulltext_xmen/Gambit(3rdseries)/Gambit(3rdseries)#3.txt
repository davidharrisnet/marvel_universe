Remy is restless fulfilling his debt to the New Son, so he follows his messenger Courier to find out more about him. Courier addresses the Crew A.S.K.E.W., a for-profit research group. One of them, the Pelican, interrupts; he has acquired a will-sapping gas, which he wants mass-produced. The canister cracks; turns out the gas has the side effect of melting your face off. The gas is sucked back into the canister; the Mengo brothers enter; they now control everyone (they are working for the Pig), except Courier; he can control every cell in his body and can’t be affected by the gas. Remy blows his way in and leaves with Courier and the canister. Fontanelle investigates Sekmeht’s dreams: digging up relics of En Sabah Nur in Egypt, confronting Ozymandias, being rescued from a fall by Remy. Fontanelle says Sekmeht mixes her need for parental approval (archeology) and her repressed desires (Remy) in her dreams. The Mengo brothers trace the canister; Remy rides to "Onslaught Alley" on the east side, where the air is still energized, to throw them off. They catch up and start shooting; Remy redirects missiles and collapses two buildings onto each other, but lets the canister drop. The homeless Huey and Quiet Bill are present during the fight. Bill, probably a mutant, has a portal of green energy around him, in which images of other realities appear, but he can’t control this. Suddenly a large portal forms and envelops the Mengo’s ship full of A.S.K.E.W. scientists. The Mengos pick up the canister and escape; Remy invites Bill to Xavier’s, but he declines. Turns out the Mengos only have the outer casing: Remy has the gas in a container and knows the Pig will come for it.
