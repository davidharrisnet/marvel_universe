Remy tried to steal data from Moira; the security system blasted the datacore into space with him still aboard. He jumps off, but his parachute catches fire and Remy crash-lands. Much debris falls towards him. (A few hours earlier) Remy and Storm fly to Scotland commercial, and reminisce about their thieving days (Uncanny X-Men #265-267), when Storm was regressed to a child’s body. She admits that she framed the Thieves' Guild for the Safilios job, and he in turn hired the Assassins' Guild, starting a clan war. She and he have each made mistakes in life. At Muir Island, Moira examines Remy's new power to delay his charges; Remy jokingly credits the green energy succubus inside him (see Ann. ’99). The X-Cutioner hires the former Elysian Guard to help him nail Remy: they had been fired after failing to stop Remy (last iss.). Fontanelle investigates Tante Mattie's dreams; in 1891 she was a child voodoo practitioner, unable to heal a powerful man, and Remy (somehow there as an adult) saved her from a vengeful mob. The electricity goes off in Muir Island; Moira has rigged the system to blast into space and explode in such a case, to protect it from Bastion or any other attempted download. Remy goes to retrieve the data (he rigged the power failure, so he could steal the data). He rides the data core up; parachutes down when it blows; and is able to save and copy the hard drive. (story has now caught up with the opening scene) Remy avoids the debris and returns to Moira’s lab and hands her the rescued hard drive. She thanks him, but he doesn’t feel heroic, as he copied the data, which he was hired to steal for the New Son. The Mengo brothers kill someone in Chicago, and are off to New York.
