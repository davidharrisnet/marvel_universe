(In the past) At age 15, Remy shepherds his cousin Etienne through the tilling, the Thieves' Guild rite of passage. They get caught by Candra in Granada, Spain; she has met Remy before, though he doesn’t know her (time-travel is hinted at). She was buying a shipment of children from the Pig; he takes Remy and Etienne to his Pig Pen training facility, intending to sell them to Viper. Remy, still learning about his own powers, blows their way out of their cells and then blows up the Hydra airship. The Pig catches Etienne and beats on Remy, who picks up a spilled deck and finds his motif of throwing charged cards. Both boys fall into the ocean, Remy is rescued by a fishing trawler, but Etienne drowns. (present) Jean-Luc informs Remy that the Pig attacked the Thieves Guild and tells him about Zoe and Shirow, whom he had to take in because they belong to the Tokyo branch. They are now missing, but Remy can track Shirow’s bio-gas (iss. 3). Fontanelle investigates the dreams of Mary Purcell's sister. Mary is dead, but her spirit will turn out to be the green ghost in Remy's body. At the Pig’s place, Shirow's flesh explodes with mind-sapping gas; Zoe is trying to rescue him, but the Mengos catch them. Remy comes to the rescue, but the Mengos explode a building onto them and plan to deliver all of them to the Pig.
