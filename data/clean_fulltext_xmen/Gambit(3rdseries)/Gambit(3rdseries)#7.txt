The Pig plans to use Shirow's mind (and skin) altering gas to bring unity and peace to the world, under his rule, of course. He has Shirow strapped into a machine that leeches the gas from his pores. The Mengo Brothers torture his captives for information, but Remy and Zoe refuse to talk. When alone Zoe tells Remy that when her brother's bio-gas started, it was painful, and the Tokyo Thieves' Guild just wanted to milk him. Zoe interfered, was ousted from the Guild, and escaped to seek the protection of the New Orleans branch. Jean-Luc worries about Remy: no word since he went after the Pig, days ago. Genard says the Guild is unable to find any trace of him or the Pig. Fontanelle investigates Scalphunter's dreams: Remy led the Marauders into the Morlock tunnels but didn't know there was going to be a Mutant Massacre. During it, he resued the child Sarah (later Marrow). Waking, Fontanelle is brought to the New Son, who asks for conclusions: she says that Remy was stupid, but not a murderer. The New Son hints at things to come, and images of Sinister and Apocalypse are seen. The Pigâ€™s base is on Mallorca, and he still uses child slaves. Zoe breaks free and blows up the power plant, which also destroys the gas sucked from her brother. Remy insists she stays and frees the children, while he goes after Shirow. The Pig realizes Remy is the boy he fought years ago (last iss.), who took his eye. They fight; Remy uses the remaining gas on him and orders him to walk off a cliff. Remy, Zoe and the freed children return to New Orleans.
