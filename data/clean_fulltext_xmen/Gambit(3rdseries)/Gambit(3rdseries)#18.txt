X-Cutioner stops Denti's car; Denti tries to arrest him, but Remy gets them out of there. Denti had chosen to die (issue #5), but when his space station collapsed, failsafe systems teleported him out of his armor. He had assumed it destroyed, but someone else now wears it. Fireballs has balls, until Remy blows them up with a glance. Then he uses some to knock down X-Cutioner. Bella Donna and the Assasins Guild question Deadpool and find he let Remy go. During the questioning Constrictor wakes and is knocked out again. Although he hired the assorted villains for the New Son, Courier calls Archangel for help, while Batroc and Zaran attack Remy again. Denti is wounded; Remy blows up the Thieves' Guild escape boat and the villains with it. Crossbones is on deck; he drops his guns when Remy charges them, then Denti pulls his gun and gets away with Remy. Crossbones crosses paths with Batroc and Zaran; they have an old feud. Deadpool pulls a gun on the Thieves' Guild, but they convince him they're just trying to help a relative. Constrictor again wakes and is again knocked out. Remy tries to catch his breath. Denti notes that he seems stronger when using his enhanced powers. Just then, Fireballs and X-Cutioner attack again. Denti considers, then arrests Fireballs. He's glad he's no longer X-Cutioner. The new one chases down Remy, but the Assassins' Guild rescues him, so Bella Donna can kill him herself. Fifolet disrupts X-Cutioner's systems, and he explodes. A building under construction topples; the debris buries Bella Donna and Remy.
