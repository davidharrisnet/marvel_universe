Rax shoots a crossbow bolt at Remy, shattering his wine goblet and ruining his shirt. Remy remote-charges the crossbow, the knife Rax pulls, and then the ground around him. Rax runs, and Remy considers letting him go but then chases him, because of his sense of responsibility and his desire to avoid Bella Donna. At the Boudreaux mansion, she is holding a vote of confidence on Remy's leadership, which Theoren and Gris-Gris have called, because of the empty casket of All Tomorrows. She advises the Guild to give him more time to prove himself. Remy chases Rax into the Metairie Cemetery, trying to forget how his father had his grandfather Jacques ousted as patriarch by a vote of confidence, in 1923. His father and Marius Bodreaux agreed to the marriage of their children six years ago, to unify the guilds and bring in “Heaven on Earth.“ Fontanelle investigates Quiet Bill's dreams of alternate Earths, finding Remy dead in each of them, always impaled through the chest. Then she sees the New Son fighting the heroes of his earth. In DC, Courier investigates government records on Black Womb, which involved federal agent Fred Duncan, Amanda Mueller and alien technology. He also finds a photo of the the X-Cutioner armor. Remy and Rax scuffle in the streets. Remy refuses to use his enhanced powers to just blow him up and has to protect bystanders. Rax shoots a bolt in his shoulder and is about to kill him, when he is interrupted by Domina, who reveals that the Neo have been watching, and then the Guild, who did have a vote: Remy won 7 to 6. Domina returns Remy to them, saying the Neo were once allies with the Old Kingdom. She claims she would have won, but Rax and Remy exchange glances: they both know Remy was superior. The New Son breaks out of a slab of rock in Siberia. He finds Remy’s message on the ground and laughs. He did not realize they thought he was the “New Son,” when it’s actually “New Sun.”
