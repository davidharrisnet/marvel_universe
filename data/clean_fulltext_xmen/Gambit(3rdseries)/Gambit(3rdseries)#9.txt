Remy easily defeats the dying Creed and considers finishing him, but he needs help with Xavier's secret (last issue). Creed agrees, so he can live to revenge himself on whomever attacked him. He will get Remy to Sinister’s hideout in exchange for Sinister jumpstarting his healing factor. They fly to Tasmania and infiltrate Sinister's base, through a portal under a rock in a river in a gorge.  Remy sees it’s like the one in Nebraska (X-Men 2nd series, #34), and Creed explains it’s the same base, with entrances around the world. The Marauders attack; Scalphunter shoots Courier and Creed; Remy harpoons Harpoon and blows up Riptide and Scalphunter. He considers destroying the clone vats, both defeating and freeing them, but Sinister interrupts. Courier, shot through the head, is still alive. (dream sequence) Fontanelle investigates the Tithe Collector's dreams and sees Remy a century ago in London, when Candra made a pact with the Thieves' Guild. Remy holds up the vial Sinister gave him in exchange for assembling the Marauders, intending to pay Sinister with it, but he tells him things aren't that serious yet. He says Creed's adamantium was removed, off-planet, and gives him a booster shot of healing factor. He hands Remy an injection that will detect frauds (see Uncanny X-Men #375), and in exchange asks that Creed be left with him. Remy doesn't want him to be able to clone him; instead, he offers him a piece of Courier, to study his cellular control (which is how he survived). Courier can grow it back, but he's getting shorter over the years. Exiting, Remy gives Creed to his worshippers, blows up Sinister's portal, and has Courier kill the cells he left behind by remote-control.
