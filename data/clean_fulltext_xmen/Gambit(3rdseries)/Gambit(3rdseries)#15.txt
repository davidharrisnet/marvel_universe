Jean Luc tells Rogue about Remy's time adventure. She goes to Anubar, who gives her a device he uses to track his daughter Sekmeht, and she finds herself in the mountains of Latveria. Seems Sekmeht found the Folding City, built by Dr. Doom had to study holes in space, which disappeared. Rogue hears her own voice from within, and investigates: it’s a maze of space-time fragments. She finds Sekmeht and the Mengos, who have been on the run (since issue #12) from the self-Exalted One, former rent-a-cop of the facility, who controls the spatial anomalies. Turns out, he's the Mengos' father. At his citadel, the New Son shows Fontanelle many variant realities, in all of which Remy dies with a spear in his belly. The Assassins' Guild has a contract on Remy, and Bella Donna prepares. When Mengo pere hears Doom is out of power, he decides to expand his anomaly to all Latveria. Rogue attacks, breaking the gauntlets that he uses to control the anomaly. Various useless gates to reality open; Rogue realizes Mengo, Sr.'s, armor is the real gate, and flies them all through him. Mengo, Sr., reaches through the rift to catch Rogue's leg, but to his surprise his own son attacks, cutting off his forearm. With only one gauntlet left, he‘s stranded inside the city. But they still don't know where Remy is. (Three months later) Mr. Sinister is monitoring mutant power levels. Sabra operates at 67%, X-Man at 85%. Then a peak 100% registers, with Remy’s signature.
