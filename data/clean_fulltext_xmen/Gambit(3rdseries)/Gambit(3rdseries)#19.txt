Remy was knocked out saving Bella Donna and himself from the exploding X-Cutioner (last issue), and she considers killing him but remembers better times. They are buried under a building, and their two guilds start digging them out but scatter when the police arrive. The New Son brings Courier into his citadel, and she protests his recent brutalities, for example towards Quiet Bill, but does nothing to stop him. The Guilds run into Batroc, Zaran, and Crossbones, separately defeat them, and then ally. Beneath the rubble, Bella Donna says she attacked Remy because she still loves him. Denti, investigating the crash site, is still figuring out how to be a good guy again. Fontanelle invades Bullseye's dream of taking over the Kingpin's organization and learns that the contract on Remy expires at dawn. Bella Donna just wanted a normal life with her husband, but Remy's stuck on Rogue. The rubble collapses; he uses his power to cushion their fall. Deciding he has no choice, he tests his newly enhanced powers and carefully disintegrates a hole to the surface. The New Son observes approvingly, and Denti gets the police to let them go. Tante Mattie rejoices that the Guilds are united; Remy considers attacking the New Son, but just then Angel swoops down on him.
