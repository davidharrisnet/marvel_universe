Remy is lying in an alley in Manhattan, beaten and about to be killed with his own cards. (8 weeks ago) Remy is able to kiss Rogue, and it tingles. He got back from the past by altering his bio-kinetic field, and now it is like a gauze wrap protecting him. (7 weeks ago) The New Son has Courier scanned, but he is still she. He dismisses Fontanelle and sends Courier with a message for various people. (6 weeks ago) Remy visits his father and is followed back to Westchester. He has been readmitted to the Thieves' Guild, refuses to say more, and gets angry when Rogue questions him. (5 weeks ago) Tante Mattie is unable to get Bella Donna to cancel the contract on Remy. (4 weeks ago) Hammer gives Constrictor new vibranium coils. He sends him to kill Remy, at Courier's behest. (3 weeks ago) Remy has trouble controlling his powers; he burns Colossus and Rogue in the Danger Room and explodes things at random. He remembers: to return from 1891 he had Sinister treat him with the contents of the mysterious vial (cf. Uncanny X-Men #350), and the improved powers seem to be a side-effect. Later, he is attacked by Batroc and Zaran and easily dismisses them. (2 weeks ago) Beast and Cecelia examine him and find evidence of surgery. He can now charge things without touching them and is constantly kinetically hyperactive. He says this happened when he manifested his powers at age eighteen, so he went to Sinister, who removed part of his brain to limit the power. The tissue was placed in the vial, and Remy was indebted to Sinister. Remy realizes Rogue and he aren't ready to move forward together and breaks up. (Last week) He returns to New Orleans and assumes control of the fractious Thieves' Guild. (present) Bullseye stabs Remy.
