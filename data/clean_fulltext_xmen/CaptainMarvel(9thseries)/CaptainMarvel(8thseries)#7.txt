Captain Marvel meets with Medusa and they discuss Ulysses and his visions. Carol visits Ulysses, and she talks to him about War Machine, and his death. She tells Ulysses that although War Machine is dead, the Project Pegasus staff are safe because of his vision. She encourages him to keep focussing on his visions, so that he and others can save innocent people. Ulysses then has another vision, involving Dr Minerva. Captain Marvel is able to track Minerva down, and with the help of Alpha Flight and the Ultimates, stops Minerva before she can detonate another disastrous weapon that would mutate civilians. Alpha Flight's board of Governors hold a meeting with Captain Marvel to discuss why she kept information about the Inhuman precognitive to herself and warn her that she stands to lose more than her job. Carol recounts the events leading up until now to the Board, and her reasons for keeping to herself the knowledge about Ulysses. Gyrich wants to have her tried for treason. Carol tries to convince the Board of the importance of Ulysses and the visions he is having, and urges them to expand Alpha Flight's mandate, or form a new unit to act on Ulysses' visions. After the Board takes time to discuss, they inform Carol that given the circumstances of this situation, she is the ideal person to lead her proposed unit, and ensure her that she will have all the resources she needs. Carol thinks about Rhodey, before setting about putting her new unit together.
