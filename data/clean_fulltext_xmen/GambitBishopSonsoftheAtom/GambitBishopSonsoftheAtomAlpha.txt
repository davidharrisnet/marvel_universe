Remy and Bishop are under fire, unable to contact help by radio. Cyclops blasts them and grapples with Bishop, saying even he can't absorb that much energy at once. Bishop's hand glows; Cyclops is reduced to a skeleton; Bishop has killed his boyhood idol! Remy shakes him from his shock; they need to escape from the mansion. They find an icy landscape and realize Iceman has been turned, too. Remy tries for the door, but he's frozen in mid-air. Then Iceman attacks Bishop. Bishop wakes from this nightmare. Xavier is there, having sensed that Bishop's mind was time traveling. He takes Bishop to the lab for Beast to conduct tests. Turns out Bishop is infected with a subdermal symbiote. Remy and Rogue have been on a date. She's not sure their relationship can be rebuilt, but she's willing to try. As they approach the mansion, it blows up. Rogue disappears, and Remy sees the windows are intact. He cautiously enters and finds the X-Men in the lab waiting for him. Something is not right.
