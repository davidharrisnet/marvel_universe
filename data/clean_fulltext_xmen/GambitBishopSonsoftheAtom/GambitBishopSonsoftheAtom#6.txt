As the Bete Noir erupts from Bishop’s chest, Remy tackles Cable out of the way, but he has a TK force field, as does Stryfe, who claims to be trying to contain the Bete Noir. Cable doesn’t trust Stryfe, but Bishop realizes the Bete Noir is the bigger threat. Once free, it will consume all life and then leave earth to search for the Phoenix force. Bishop asks Remy to kill him, since he is the Bete Noir's anchor in this world. Stryfe has another option: he absorbs it into himself. He apologizes to Cable for those he killed and for everything else, as the power overload shatters his body: character redemption through self-sacrifice. Cable heads back to the mansion to make sure Stryfe didn't leave any surprises behind. Remy, angry at his insouciance, asks how they can be sure Cable isn't manipulating their minds; he says they can't and leaves. The Witness has disappeared, evidently having seen enough. Bishop and Remy walk off together, the start of a beautiful friendship ?
