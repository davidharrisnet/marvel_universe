Remy, suspicious of his teammates, takes a seat. Beast shows him that Bishop has a symbiote; he tries to leave, but Xavier stops him, so he throws cards and kicks Xavier in the head. Surprised, the X-Men go down, all except Storm, who powers up. Bishop realizes she intends to kill him, and he vaguely remembers her leaving the mansion with part of the team (after X-Men 2nd series #109). “Storm“ attacks, but it just tingles. Remy and Bishop realize the X-Men are illusions, but Beast thumps Remy: only the X-women were illusions, and they fade away. Beast, Nightcrawler, and Xavier (!) are under mind control; it must be Stryfe (X-Men 2nd series 2000 Annual). Remy is more concerned that Bishop is emitting energy not his own. He throws cards and blows a hole in the floor, so they can escape. Bishop chokes him, saying their duty was to rescue Xavier, but Remy says Stryfe must be after Bishop's parasite. He tells Bishop to trust him, and they walk down the Morlock tunnel together.
