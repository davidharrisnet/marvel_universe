Stryfe begs for help; Bishop smacks him, because his Legacy Virus killed so many. Remy has to pull him off. Stryfe zaps them both, saying he's still powerful, even if he needs their help. Remy says they should stop fighting and go out to a diner; Stryfe telepathically masks their appearances. Stryfe: "You have no right to judge me, Bishop. You did not live my life." He tells them his story. In the future, Rachel Summers cloned him from Nathan as a precaution, since the baby had the T-O virus; he was captured by Apocalypse, who raised him to become his vessel, till he found out he was a clone. His life had no purpose, and Stryfe battled Cable where- and whenever he could, as he only was his imitation. Bishop has enough and blasts him through the wall. Stryfe continues that he was demented when he created the Legacy Virus and wishes he could repair the damage, as he now repairs the wall. He wants protection from Cable, who wants to kill him.
