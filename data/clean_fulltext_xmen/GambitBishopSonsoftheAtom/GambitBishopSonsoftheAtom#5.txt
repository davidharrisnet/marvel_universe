Remy and Bishop enter the cemetery, hopping over the T-O and wondering how to stop Cable. They find him standing over Stryfe; he telepathically made him experience all the deaths he caused. He plans to kill him, justifying it as "an aberrant form of suicide," since he's only his clone. He has seen the future and will act to prevent it. Stryfe, in shock, whispers that since Kelly's death, all futures have been disrupted, and nothing is certain. Remy and Bishop try to dissuade Cable, but he forces Stryfe to explain the Bete Noir. It is an ancient force, banished by the Phoenix Force to earthâ€™s core and called by many names including Satan. When Bishop returned from the Chronomancer future, it bonded to him, the perfect host thanks to his mutant power, and it plans first to morally corrupt and eventually to destroy all life. The Witness gives Bishop a shirt similar to Havok's containment suit, to contain it. Stryfe admits he wanted to use the Bete Noir to destroy the world, but says it's just his nature, like Remy is a scoundrel-hero, Cable a reluctant messiah, and Bishop a law-enforcer. None of them can change. Cable is unconvinced and raises his gun, but just then the Bete Noir erupts from Bishop's chest.
