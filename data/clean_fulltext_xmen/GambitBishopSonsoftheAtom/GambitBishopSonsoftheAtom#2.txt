Bishop and Remy fly commercial to the Big O; fighter and lover, they are an odd couple. Remy reads Tome magazine, which gives Kelly's death an anti-mutant spin. Remy has Hercule pick them up at the airport and drive them; his boss Mastif owes him a favor. Bishop still thinks they shouldnâ€™t have abandoned the others to Stryfe, but Remy says to trust him. They stop at a beautifully serene cemetery, where Remy played as a child, and enter a mausoleum. Bishop grows impatient and wants answers from Remy. Below ground sits an old friend, the Witness, amid collected super-hero souvenirs. He explains that his power is to remember all possible futures as well as the past. Remy came across him when he was six, but he's been out of touch since he joined the X-Men. Bishop has trouble accepting this is the same man from his own timeline, who he thought was an aged Remy. The Witness says they don't always see what's there, and he points out that Stryfe is behind them on the floor, asking for their help.
