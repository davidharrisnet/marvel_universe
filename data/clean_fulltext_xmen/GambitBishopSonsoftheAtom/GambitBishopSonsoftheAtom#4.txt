Bishop and Remy say Stryfe deserves to die; even he admits he brought it on himself; the Witness says he's never seen an X-Man, past or future, kill for retribution. But he's not allowed to tell them the whole future, and that wouldn't be any fun, anyway. Over pie, Bishop asks Stryfe about his symbiote; it is the Bete Noir, power beyond imagination, especially coupled to Bishop. He admits he wanted to use it to destroy the world, and thatâ€™s why he possessed the X-Men. The fork in Bishop's hand becomes a techno-organic gauntlet; Remy throws a card, shattering it; Stryfe says it's Cable's work. Techno-organics engulf Stryfe and the Witness, and Bishop and Remy go under trying to rescue them. Suddenly it disappears, and the waitress says Stryfe's twin took him away while they were roughhousing. Remy leaves a necklace to pay for the damages and says Cable will kill Stryfe at a nexus in time, to prevent his return (or else Stryfe could return from death once more). The nearest one is the Witness's mausoleum, and they find that the entire graveyard has been T-O'd.
