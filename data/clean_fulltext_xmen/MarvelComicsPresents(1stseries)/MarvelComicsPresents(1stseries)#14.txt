First Story:   Colossus finally punches Number Six like she asked. One Cold Warrior soldier yells for them to not let Colossus take her inside and everyone opens fire on him. Colossus shields Number Six with his metal body and rushes back into the house, breaking the boards on the door down in the process.  Colossus yells for everyone to take cover, but Bruce tells him that it’s okay, since the Cold Warriors are backing off for now. Colossus wants to see to his captive’s bruises, but she tells him not to worry about them and explains herself. She tells everyone that she is called Number Six and that she is a member of a team of super-soldiers called the Cold Warriors. They have all given up their natural bodies for power granting cybernetic implants, like the metal her body is laced with that makes it so she can barely feel anymore. She only looks like a woman now.  Getting off this tangent, Number Six explains that their mission was to fight a cold war as commissioned by the CIA, but they were so secret that this “Operation: Cold War” has been forgotten about. They were supposed to keep America safe from terrorists in secret, away from the media. The United States is full of fanatics the people don’t know about and their job was to keep it that way. The leader of the group has an unnatural fear of the press and so Number Six says she wanted to alert the media to this renegade anti-terror cell’s activities. She apologizes and says it gets hard to know what to fight for when things go sour and that everyone in here is to be killed for seeing that secret murder in the woods. Given this, she says she should have quit a long time ago and slowly passes out on the couch saying it’s hard to know when you’ve gone too far for what you believe in.
