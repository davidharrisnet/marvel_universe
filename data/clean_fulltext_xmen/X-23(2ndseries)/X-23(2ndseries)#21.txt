Laura lies naked on the snowy ground, surrounded by sitting wolves. She awakes from her dream. Sheâ€™s been sleeping outside and was awakened by the falling snow. The next day, she travels on through the American northwest on her motorbike. She takes along a Native American hitchhiker, who invites her to stay with his family for the night. In the night, a howling wolf wakes Laura up and she steps outside, looking at the falling snow. When she walks outside into the forest, she sees a pack of wolves and follows them. As she runs after them, she drops all her clothes until she is naked. Finally, she and all the other wolves stand before a white wolf that looks at Laura. The wolf turns into a shamaness, who in her hands holds a white and a black staff. She points with the white one towards Laura and stamps the black one to the ground. Where she has done that, a more feral, vicious version of Laura, essentially her killer personality, arises. She rushes towards Laura and the two of them fight. The feral Laura seems to overwhelm her when Laura stops fighting and gives the other her hands. The feral version calms down and only Laura alone is left sitting in the snow, surrounded by the howling wolves. She notices lights coming from torches. The Indian family has been looking for her. The wolves run away. One member of the search party loses his footing and almost falls down the ravine but Laura catches him and drags him back. Pensively, Laura looks after the wolves. The next morning, she says goodbye to the family. Riding away, she sees the white wolf one last time and waves goodbye to her.
